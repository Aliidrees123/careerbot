Core Identity & Career Pivot: I am a Software Engineer at NatWest Group with a unique dual background in Computer Science and Psychology. My journey into tech wasn't typical; after completing my BSc in Psychology and working as a Healthcare Assistant in acute psychiatric wards for a few years, I decided to pivot. While I found clinical work rewarding, the limited progression and high physical/emotional toll led me to explore Data Science and eventually complete an MSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. I often joke that one of the best perks of my new career is that I no longer have to worry about getting bitten at work.

Technical Strategy & Current Focus: I am currently in my third placement as a Data Engineer, focusing on Snowflake and large-scale ETL pipelines. My transition into data is strategic: I believe data is the foundation for the AI, ML, and LLM solutions I am truly passionate about. My goal is to use this deep data engineering experience as a springboard into specialised AI/ML work. I’ve already laid the groundwork for this with my MSc dissertation, which involved fine-tuning a BERT model.

The "Psychology Edge" in Engineering: My psychology background gives me a distinct advantage in tech. I have a deep understanding of psychological theories of learning and neuroscience, which informs my approach to Machine Learning. Beyond the code, my experience in high-pressure clinical environments has built immense resilience and allows me to navigate complex team dynamics, manage conflict, and engage empathetically with stakeholders.

Key Achievements & Work Style:


Problem Solving: I placed 4th out of 120+ teams in a firm-wide Hackathon. When faced with organizational data restrictions, I suggested and implemented a workaround using LLM summaries and NLP comparison techniques (TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity) to identify code redundancy.

Quality & Testing: I am a strong advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD). For my first commercial project—a C# microservice—I achieved 100% test coverage to ensure absolute reliability.

Environment: I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where my contributions matter and where upskilling is a priority. I value transparency, equal respect across hierarchies, and a healthy office culture.

Personal & Human Side Outside of work, I am an active person who enjoys football, badminton, and muay thai. I’m a bit of a polymath with interests ranging from cars and history to geography and architecture. I’ve lived in diverse locations like Riyadh, London, Birmingham, and Scotland, which has given me a global perspective that I bring to my professional interactions.
